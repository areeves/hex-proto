<h1>Saucy 7 Gamma </h1>

<p>
On the smallest of the three moons orbiting the seventh planet in
the Saucy System live a large population of large bees. Enormous
bees. Mind-breakingly large bees. And, where you have lots of
mind-breakingly large bees, you have mind-breakingly large amounts of
honey. Low-gravity honey. The good stuff. 

<p>
Where there's money to be made, people flock to cash-in, and the
Golden Rush of Saucy 7 Gamma is no exception. Interprising
individuals (who hire more expendable individuals, that's you) have
tireless sought to eliminate any remaining humans without diabetes.
For something done in space, the process is surprisingly
uncomplicated- go in, get honey, don't die, leave. The not-dieing is
the tricky part as the bees lurk unseen in the large pools of honey.
As dangerous as a bridge run on the Shattered Plains. 

<p>
Fortunately, one lazy worker laid down on the rock at the bottom
of an empty honey pit and found he could hear the bees moving around
in the adjacent pits. Turns out one accurately determine how many
adjacent pits are occupied, just not which ones. Needless to say,
it's still dangerous, but brighter people will have a better chance
of surival.
